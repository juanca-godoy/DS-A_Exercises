# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python â€“ Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from **Data Structures and Algorithms in Python** (Goodrich, Tamassia, & Goldwasser, 2013).  

The goal of this project is to practice and reinforce concepts from the book by solving the end-of-chapter exercises in Python. Each chapterâ€™s exercises are organized into their own directory for clarity and ease of navigation.

## ðŸ“– Book Structure

The book is organized into the following chapters:

1. **Python Primer** â€“ introduction to Python basics, control flow, functions, exceptions, iterators, and modules.  
2. **Object-Oriented Programming** â€“ classes, inheritance, design patterns, and Pythonâ€™s OOP principles.  
3. **Algorithm Analysis** â€“ experimental and theoretical analysis, asymptotic notation, growth rates.  
4. **Recursion** â€“ examples, analysis, design techniques, and recursion depth in Python.  
5. **Array-Based Sequences** â€“ lists, tuples, strings, and dynamic arrays.  
6. **Stacks, Queues, and Deques** â€“ abstract data types and implementations.  
7. **Linked Lists** â€“ singly, circularly, and doubly linked lists, with positional list ADTs.  
8. **Trees** â€“ general and binary trees, traversals, and expression trees.  
9. **Priority Queues** â€“ heaps, adaptable priority queues, and heap-sort.  
10. **Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists** â€“ dictionaries, hashing, collision handling, skip lists, sets.  
11. **Search Trees** â€“ binary search trees, AVL trees, splay trees, red-black trees, and (2,4)-trees.  
12. **Sorting and Selection** â€“ merge-sort, quick-sort, linear-time sorts, and selection algorithms.  
13. **Text Processing** â€“ string matching, tries, compression, and dynamic programming.  
14. **Graph Algorithms** â€“ graph representations, traversals, shortest paths, spanning trees.  
15. **Memory Management and B-Trees** â€“ memory allocation, garbage collection, caching, external memory.  
A. **Character Strings in Python**  
B. **Useful Mathematical Facts**

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each chapter has its own folder, containing solutions to exercises from that chapter.  
For example:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Ch01_Python_Primer/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Creativity
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Reinforcement
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Ch02_Object_Oriented_Programming/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- Filenames follow the exercise numbering used in the book.  
- Where appropriate, solutions include comments explaining the approach and references to the problem statement.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project serves as:
- A structured way to **practice Python and algorithmic thinking**.  
- A personal reference of **exercise solutions** for future study.  
- A demonstration of applying **data structures and algorithms** to problem solving.
